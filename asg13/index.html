      <h1>My Dream Job: UI/UX Designer (NYC)</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        My dream job is to be a UI/UX Designer in New York City because I enjoy designing clean and easy-to-use interfaces.
        I like solving problems by organizing information and making pages feel simple and clear.
        I want to build skills in wireframing, prototyping, and user research.
        I also want to work with a team so I can learn how real products are designed and improved.
