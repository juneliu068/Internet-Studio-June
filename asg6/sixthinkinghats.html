    <h1>Six Thinking Hats</h1>

    <section id="summary">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><em>
        We’re building a UTD only marketplace where students can buy and sell furniture, school supplies, and dorm essentials. It focuses on safety and convenience: @utdallas.edu login, in-app chat, and suggested public meet-up spots on campus for quick pickups. The goal is to save students money and time, reduce waste through reuse, and make trading feel trustworthy. We’ll start with a small simple version, measure listings and completed trades, and improve based on student feedback.</em>

        Our users are UTD students buying and selling furniture and school supplies. We need to know what items they want most, when they shop, and how they like to pay. We also need safe meet-up spots on campus and what fees feel fair. We can learn this with a short survey and a small pilot.</em>

        Scams, spam posts, and low inventory can hurt trust. Unsafe or confusing meet ups are a risk. Disputes over price or payment may happen and will need rules.</em>
