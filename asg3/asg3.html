  <h2>1. Dos and donts of web design #6 violation</h2>
  <p>
    Example of clickable elements are not obvious:
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon homepage</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Better ux through storytelling</h2>
  <p>
    Telling your project as a story can make your ideas clearer. You pick a main user what they want, and what’s is in their way. Then you map the steps, how they start, what they do, and how it ends. This shows missing steps and extra features you don’t need. It also sets a very simple goal for success, so you can focus on the few things that matter most.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Ways to establish hierarchy</h2>
  <p>
    Use type to show importance by making headings bigger and bolder, using higher contrast for key info, adding white space, placing important text first and keeping alignment consistent, and pairing fonts so one is for titles and one for body.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good example of hierarchy:
    <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple iPhone page</a>.

  <h2>Creative Brief: Campus Buy and Sell Marketplace</h2>

  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    College students struggle to afford and transport furniture and school essentials during frequent move ins and move outs. Existing options like Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist are messy to search, lack student only verification, make pickup hard to validate or trust, and the costs are higher.
  </p>

  <h3>Audience</h3>
  <p>
    Primary: Undergraduate and graduate students (around 18–26) at UTD who need to buy or sell furniture, dorm/apt, and school supplies. Secondary, recent alumni and campus staff in the same situations.
  </p>

  <h3>Competition</h3>
  <p>
    Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, OfferUp, thrift stores, and informal campus group chats. Most lack .edu verification, campus specific filters (dorms and buildings), or built in pickup scheduling and safety factors.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Messages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Student only, verified with .edu for safer trades.</li>
    <li>Local, fast, search by dorm/building, same day pickup.</li>
    <li>Affordable, sustainable, save money and reduce waste.</li>
    <li>Simple, list an item in under 60 seconds.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Call to Action</h3>
  <p>
    “List your first item” or “Find deals near your dorm.” Encourage users to sign in with their .edu email, post a listing, and schedule pickup through the built in calendar.
  </p>

  <h3>How to Measure Success</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>-% of new users who verify with .edu and list or buy within a certain amount of days.</li>
    <li>-Average time to first offer and days to sell for all categories.</li>
    <li>-Weekly active buyers/sellers, active listings per certain amount of students.</li>
  </ul>
