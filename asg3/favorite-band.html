  <h3>Why They Are My Favorite?</h3>
	    The Worship Initiative is my favorite band because their music helps me feel closer to God. Their songs are full of Scripture, heartfelt, and always remind me that worship is about more than music—it’s about encountering Him. I love how their sound is both beautiful and genuine, and it always lifts me up whether I’m at church, at home, or on the go.
