    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <p>Here are three things I learned from my reading material</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>I learned how HTML makes up structure of a web page using elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists!</li>
        <li>I also learned that CSS is used to style a page, making it more appealing visuallt with different colors, layouts, and fonts.</li>
        <li>I lastly learned that Netlify is a platform that allows easy deployment of websites by simply uploading files or connecting a Git repository.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>My Semester Project Idea</h2>
    <p>
        For my project this semester, I want to make a small portfolio website where I can post 
        my assignments and maybe even some of my personal projects! It will give me a place to practice 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also having something I can share with others and future jobs i may apply to.
