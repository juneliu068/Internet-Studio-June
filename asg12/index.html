	<h1>12 of My Favorite Movies</h1>
	<p class=summary>
    These are some of my favorite movies because they all mix heart, humor, and imagination in different ways. I love stories about unlikely heroes, whether it’s a rat who wants to be a chef, shy girls who discover secret worlds, or ordinary people caught up in something bigger than themselves. Many of these films are beautifully animated with magical creatures and whimsical worlds that make me feel like a kid again, while others explore faith, friendship, and love in a sincere way. Together they remind me to be brave, follow my calling, and believe that kindness and hope can change everything.
