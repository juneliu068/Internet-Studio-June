  <title>ASG2 – Structured Content vs Semantic HTML</title>

  <h1>Conversations with Robots: Voice, Smart Agents & the Case for Structured Content</h1>

  <h2>1. What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h2>
  <p>
    Structured content is how you organize information into smaller, reusable parts that clearly describe what the content is, no matter where it’s used (for example like in websites, or apps). Semantic HTML is how you show that info on a webpage using meaningful HTML tags, like < header > or < article >, so that people, search engines, and assistive tools know what each part means.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How do they work together?</h2>
  <p>
    They work together because structured content provides the clean pieces of information, and semantic HTML is what gives those pieces meaning on a webpage. When you combine them, the content is not only organized but also easy for people, search engines, and smart assistants to read and use.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Why is it important to have both?</h2>
  <p>
    It’s important to have both because structured content makes information clear and reusable, while semantic HTML makes sure that meaning comes through on a webpage. Together, they help search engines, smart agents, and screen readers understand the content, so it’s easier to find, more accessible, and can be used across different platforms.

  <h2> Similar Websites to My Project Idea</h2>
  <p>
    For my semester project, I plan to create a small portfolio website where I can post
    my assignments and personal projects. Here are some websites that are similar in idea
    and can inspire my work:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages Portfolios</a> – Developers use this to host simple, personal portfolio sites.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank">Behance</a> – A platform for designers and creatives to share portfolios and projects.</li>
    <li><a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> – A showcase site for creative work and design portfolios.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Reflections on Readings</h2>

  <h3>Denise Jacobs</h3>
  <p>
    Jacobs says the inner critic is like a troll that holds us back . I feel like the method that would help me most is being kinder abnd more forgiving to myself and using positive self talk. If I stop focusing on mistakes and remind myself that learning takes time, I’ll definetly feel less pressure and more confident to keep going and trying.

  <h3>David McRaney</h3>
  <p>
    Hyperbolic discounting means people choose smaller rewards now instead of waiting for bigger ones later on. McRaney says one way to fight this is by pre-committing, like setting a plan or deadline ahead of time. This works well for me because once I set a clear deadline or tell someone else, I feel way more responsible and more likely to stick with it.
  </p>

  <h3>Networks</h3>
  <p>
    The reading talks about four kinds of power in networks. As a new web publisher, I don’t control big platforms or rules, but I do have the power to share my own work online. Even if it’s small, it still gives me a voice and allows me connect with others.
