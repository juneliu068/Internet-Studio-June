      <h2>Sketching vs. Wireframe Software</h2>

      <h3>Advantages of sketching</h3>
      <p>
        Sketching wireframes is fast and keeps things flexible. It helps you explore a lot of ideas really quickly
        without having to worry about perfection. Because sketches are simple, you can
        focus on layout and user flow. It also makes it easy to collaborate in person, mark changes,
        and brainstorm quickly before committing to digital structure.
      </p>

      <h3>Disadvantages of sketching</h3>
      <p>
        Sketches can be pretty hard to share with fellow workers that are remote and can be unclear if the drawings are rough.They also don’t scale well for responsiveness or complex UI components. Compared to software sketches are less finalized and harder to reuse.

      <h2>Which Wireframing Style Fits My Project?</h2>
      <p>
        For my project, I think a mix of hand drawnsketches and low-fidelity digital wireframes would probably work the best. Sketching helps me brainstorm and try multiple layout ideas very quickly. After that, creating a simple
        digital wireframe makes it easier to organize my content, adjust spacing, and share with peers and fellow workers  for feedback. This hybrid approach keeps the early stages creative and fast, while still giving me a
        clean version I can improve into higher fidelity designs later on.
