   <h1>Uncle Iroh</h1>
   <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>Uncle Iroh is a fictional character in Nickelodeon's animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender, and The Legend of Korra, and is part of the Avatar: The Last Airbender world. Created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, the character was voiced by Mako in the first two seasons and, due to Mako's death, by Greg Baldwin in the third season and the sequel series The Legend of Korra.

     Iroh is a very powerful firebender—i.e., he has the power to telekinetically create and manipulate fire—and a retired general of the Fire Nation. He is the elder brother of Fire Lord Ozai, the ruler of the Fire Nation and leader of its campaign to conquer the other three nations.[2] During the narrative of the series, he accompanies his exiled nephew Zuko on his quest to capture the series's protagonist Aang to restore the young prince's honor and birthright; Iroh acts as a mentor who seeks to help his nephew become a better person than his father.</p>
   <h2>Why would he make a good leader?</h2>
     <p>Uncle Iroh would make a strong leader because he pairs deep wisdom with genuine compassion, guiding others through humility rather than ego or fear. He listens first, de-escalates conflict, and seeks balanced solutions that protect both people and principles. A seasoned general who learned from his mistakes, he values accountability and growth, favoring diplomacy while understanding when firm action is needed. He mentors rather than commands, builds coalitions across differences, and centers justice, mercy, and the common good—qualities that create stable institutions and a kinder, more resilient society.</p>
